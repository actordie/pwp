## Milestone 1 Feedback
I really like your idea of creating a site that demonstrates your success in our program to the Kellogg Foundation and NMWTC, but I have some questions about what your ideas for your site content are specifically. 

Your purpose, audience and goal are very narrow and specific. I am wondering if a little more breadth here might actually be better. Just an idea - but how about creating a professional portfolio site that both demonstrates your coding skill set while at same time giving credit and thanks to the Kellogg Foundation and NMWTC for their role in your education. You could even highlight these programs with the intent to educate others on these opportunities that are available. This might be a way to design a PWP that serves more than one purpose and goal, and would be targeted to a much broader audience. Creating your project around one specific end user - Ms. Tabron - to the exclusion of other end users, is a VERY narrow and specific target audience. Just a thought.

Overall this is a good start, but I am concerned that it might be a little too narrow, and I would like to know more about what you envision for this project. Your project is set up correctly, and you're on the right track with your HTML. There were a few technical issues that I want to bring to your attention, see **Edits &amp; Suggestions** below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/), but I'd like to hear about your ideas a bit more.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Move the `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag down inside the `<head>` tag
- Missing `<title>` tag
- Your `<h1>` tag belongs inside the `<body>`, not inside the `<head>`
